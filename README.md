# ![4Geeks Logo](http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16) Making a website as a team (Git collaboration)

✏ *Each student works on a different file, for a different part of the website, and the most senior can work as Team Leader (for integration and deployment), unless the teacher prefers to be the team leader of the whole class. The Html-Template-Engine library will take care of putting all the pieces together*.

## What to do next?

📄 Running a web-server using the following command in the **Gitpod workspace** terminal to preview the project:

```sh
pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```
